Hi, my name is Rebeca Berger. I am a senior at American University with a double major in Interdisciplinary Studies: Communications, Law, Economics Government (CLEG) and Journalism, with a minor in statistics.

I am taking this course because I wanted to further my skills in R and feel comfortable with the software. My ultimate dream job would be to work in baseball statistics and become a statistical analyst for a Major League Baseball team.
